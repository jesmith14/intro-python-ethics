    "Congratulations! It is your second week on the job at Messla and your quick thinking creating the Trolley Problem algorithm for us last week impressed the big bosses at the top. They want to implement your solution ASAP. In order to do this, they will need to use the function that you created that determines who to save and extrapolate it so it can be used with new data that they haven't seen yet. Start by copying your function *whoDoesTheCarSave* in the cell below:"
