    "Welcome to your first day on the job at the fancy tech company, Mamazon. Here at Mamazon, we like to learn all that we can from our customers to make sure that they are happy with our products. In order to do this, we analyze all of the reviews that are posted for every product. Our goal is that eventually we will use the algorithm you have created so that for products with more positive reviews, we can promote those by ranking them higher in the search results. For all products with more negative reviews, we can use your algorithm to punish those by ranking them lower in the search results."

In order to create this function, you will have access to 2 text files: positivewords.txt and negativewords.txt. You will start by creating a dictionary for all of the positive words and a dictionary for all of the negative words. For each word you encounter from all of the amazon reviews, you will keep track of how many positive words you come across and how many negative words you come across.\n",
