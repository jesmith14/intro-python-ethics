# Ethics for Introductory Python Coding Classes

Welcome to my intro CS ethics curriculum! This repository includes a full semester's worth of material and case studies to teach introductory coding in python through the use of modern ethics, HCI, and STS case studies.

This content was intended for students who have never coded before who are seeking to learn python in a fun, interactive, ethical, and relevant way. This content was originally taught in an undergraduate university-level course, however it can be modified for high school students as well.

All solutions to the case studies have been removed, but if you are an educator and are seeking to teach this content in your classroom -- please reach out via email to jessie.smith-1@colorado.edu and I am happy to provide you with the solutions.

Start by reading the overview.docx file and then go from there. If you have any questions about this course content, please don't hesitate to reach out!
